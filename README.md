# Project: Dynamics in Monetary Policy Models

This is the course project for FE5213.

## Overview

Central banks aim to stabilize inflation and output fluctuations using monetary policy instruments such as the interest rate, typically via a Taylor rule. The analysis of monetary policy is an important issue in New Keynesian monetary economics. In this project, we will carry out two analyses using Python: (1) the linear dynamics in a monetary model; (2) the solution to a central bankâ€™s optimal policy problem.

The requirements for the linear model and optimal model can be found in the `doc` folder.

## Codes

All the source codes for this project can be reached in the `src` folder.

- `config.py`: store some path variables and benchmark parameters.
- For the linear monetary model, see codes in `linear_model.py` and `Linear_Dynamics.ipynb`.
- For the optimal monetary policy problem, see codes in `Optimal_Model.ipynb`.

## Results

The `results` folder saves all the plots for the two models, separated in `linear_model` and `optimal_model` file.

You can also refer to the whole project report in this folder.
